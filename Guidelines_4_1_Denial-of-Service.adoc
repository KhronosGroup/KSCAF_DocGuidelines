=== {chapter-id}.{counter:chapter-sub-id}. Denial-of-Service (DoS)
For both a safety hazard mitigation and cyber-attack point of view DoS should be identified and the risk reduced. DoS could occur via two attack vectors:

1.  Data handling overloading
2.  Calculating for results

The safety critical API should be accommodate parameters, size or time, or return status results accordingly. A Watchdog system may also be necessary to identify and mitigate DoS attacks.
