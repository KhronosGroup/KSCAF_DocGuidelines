==== {chapter-id}.{chapter-sub-id}.{counter:section-id}. Unique ID

Some safety standards like the ISO 26262 require an application or implementation to be able to show or return (in the case of a library) information to uniquely identify itself on request. For example such information could be the version number, name, release build number.

This information helps investigators understand the make up of the system and trace versions with changes.
