The implementation of the SC API must have deterministic execution timing in real time systems and potentially non-deterministic techniques, such as dynamic memory allocation and locking, should be avoided where feasible. The API implementation must define the expected real-time characteristics, and particularly, whether hard or soft real-time is targeted. For all potentially blocking functions, a timeout option must be provided.
