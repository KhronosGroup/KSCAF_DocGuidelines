=== {chapter-id}.{chapter-sub-id}.{counter:section-id}. Lost context

Also see:

- Error handling


With a close relationship to handling non-recoverable errors a lost context can be associated to such undefined states. Methods need to be devised so that the client is either made aware of a bad condition or should it continue polling the device it receives defined content such as:

- an approriate 'screen image'
- silent audio channel
- valid data
- data that can be interpreted as not valid

The SC API specification when appropriate can give guideance on such states and the expected content should an external device sample it.
